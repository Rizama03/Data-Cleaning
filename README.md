# Mobiles and Movies Data Set Cleaning for Feature Extraction and Prediction.
An end to end python project dessigned to clean and structure raw uncleaned dataset, preparing them for feature extraction and predictive modelling.
## Data Collection
I got both datasets (i.e for [mobiles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santoshgupta01/uncleaned-mobile-dataset) and [movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharatnatrayn/movies-dataset-for-feature-extracion-prediction)) from kaggle's open source platform.
## Data Cleaning 
After the data collection process, I conducted the cleaning and restructuring process by using the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- re or regex (regular expression) module

The cleaning process involved:

- correcting of mispelled mobile and movie data
- removing of non-ASCII characters from cells
- relocating of misplaced data to appropriate feature columns
- eliminating Nan values and incorrectly placed special characters
- restructuring of cell content for better visualization
- creating new columns to represent unique features
